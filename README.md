# Job-Application
This Spring MVC Job Application Platform allows users to add and view job postings. It follows a three-layer architecture (Controller, Service, Repository). The Controller handles GET (JSP pages) and POST (JobPost object) requests, the Service calls the Repository, and the Repository stores jobs in an in-memory list with default posts.
